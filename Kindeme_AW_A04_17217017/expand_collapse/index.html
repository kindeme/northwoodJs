			<h1>Murach's HTML5 and CSS3 (4th Edition)</h1>
			<h2>Book description</h2>
			<p>
				With this book, you can teach yourself how to design web pages
				the way the professionals do, by using HTML and CSS in tandem to
				structure and format the page content. It begins with a crash
				course that teaches you more about HTML and CSS than you can
				learn from most full books. That includes a chapter on
				Responsive Web Design that shows you how to build responsive
				websites that will look and work right on all devices, from
				phones to tablets to desktop computers.

					After that, this book shows you how to enhance your web
					pages with features like images, forms with built-in data
					validation, and audio and video clips. You'll also learn how
					to use JavaScript and jQuery to add features like image
					rollovers, image swaps, and slide shows. You'll learn how to
					use jQuery UI and jQuery plugins to add features like
					accordions, tabs, carousels, and slide shows. And you'll
					learn how to use jQuery Mobile to develop separate websites
					for mobile devices.
